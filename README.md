# moriyaShrineDownloader
moriyaShrineDownloader - a tool to help you download games from the Moriya Shrine website without waiting.

Tested in Python 3.9.7
## Usage
The script asks you to input the name of the file you want to download and then downloads it in the same directory as the script. If you want to add your own entries for whatever reason and you have the url to the file from the Moriya Shrine's website then feel free to add it in the json.
